The field of metagenomics has been responsible for substantial advances in microbial ecology, evolution, and diversity over the past 5 to 10 years, and many research laboratories are actively engaged in it now. With the growing numbers of activities also comes a plethora of methodological knowledge and expertise that should guide future developments in the field. This review summarizes the current opinions in metagenomics, and provides practical guidance and advice on sample processing, sequencing technology, assembly, binning, annotation, experimental design, statistical analysis, data storage, and data sharing. As more metagenomic datasets are generated, the availability of standardized procedures and shared data storage and analysis becomes increasingly important to ensure that output of individual projects can be assessed and compared.},

However, despite a multitude of recent studies incorporating these methods, many questions regarding how environmental samples should be collected and stored still persist. Here, we assess the impact of different soil storage conditions on microbial community composition using Illumina-based {16S} {rRNA} V4 amplicon sequencing. Both storage time and temperature affected bacterial community composition and structure. Frozen samples maintained the highest alpha diversity and differed least in beta diversity, suggesting the utility of cold storage for maintaining consistent communities. Samples stored for intermediate times (three and seven days) had both the highest alpha diversity and the largest differences in overall beta diversity, showing the degree of community change after sample collection. These divergences notwithstanding, differences in neither storage time nor storage temperature substantially altered overall communities relative to more than 500 previously examined soil samples. These results systematically support previous studies and stress the importance of methodological consistency for accurate characterization and comparison of soil microbiological assemblages.},

For example, as of summer 2013, {MG}-{RAST} has been used to annotate over 110,000 data sets totaling over 43 Terabases. With metagenomic sequencing finding even wider adoption in the scientific community, the existing web-based analysis tools and infrastructure in {MG}-{RAST} provide limited capability for data retrieval and analysis, such as comparative analysis between multiple data sets. Moreover, although the system provides many analysis tools, it is not comprehensive. By opening {MG}-{RAST} up via a web services {API} (application programmers interface) we have greatly expanded access to {MG}-{RAST} data, as well as provided a mechanism for the use of third-party analysis tools with {MG}-{RAST} data. This {RESTful} {API} makes all data and data objects created by the {MG}-{RAST} pipeline accessible as {JSON} objects. As part of the {DOE} Systems Biology Knowledgebase project ({KBase}, http://kbase.us) we have implemented a web services {API} for {MG}-{RAST}. This {API} complements the existing {MG}-{RAST} web interface and constitutes the basis of {KBase}'s microbial community capabilities. In addition, the {API} exposes a comprehensive collection of data to programmers. This {API}, which uses a {RESTful} (Representational State Transfer) implementation, is compatible with most programming environments and should be easy to use for end users and third parties. It provides comprehensive access to sequence data, quality control results, annotations, and many other data types. Where feasible, we have used standards to expose data and metadata. Code examples are provided in a number of languages both to show the versatility of the {API} and to provide a starting point for users. We present an {API} that exposes the data in {MG}-{RAST} for consumption by our users, greatly enhancing the utility of the {MG}-{RAST} service.},

@article{Williams2001RNAseq,
    abstract = {{RNA}-seq is widely used to determine differential expression of genes or transcripts as well as identify novel transcripts, identify allele-specific expression, and precisely measure translation of transcripts. Thoughtful experimental design and choice of analysis tools are critical to ensure high-quality data and interpretable results. Important considerations for experimental design include number of replicates, whether to collect paired-end or single-end reads, sequence length, and sequencing depth. Common analysis steps in all {RNA}-seq experiments include quality control, read alignment, assigning reads to genes or transcripts, and estimating gene or transcript abundance. Our aims are two-fold: to make recommendations for common components of experimental design and assess tool capabilities for each of these steps. We also test tools designed to detect differential expression, since this is the most widespread application of {RNA}-seq. We hope that these analyses will help guide those who are new to {RNA}-seq and will generate discussion about remaining needs for tool improvement and development. Curr. Protoc. Hum.

    abstract = {
                Ecosystems are shaped by complex communities of mostly unculturable microbes. Metagenomes provide a fragmented view of such communities, but the ecosystem functions of major groups of organisms remain mysterious. To better characterize members of these communities, we developed methods to reconstruct genomes directly from mate-paired short-read metagenomes. We closed a genome representing the as-yet uncultured marine group {II} Euryarchaeota, assembled de novo from 1.7\% of a metagenome sequenced from surface seawater. The genome describes a motile, photo-heterotrophic cell focused on degradation of protein and lipids and clarifies the origin of proteorhodopsin. It also demonstrates that high-coverage mate-paired sequence can overcome assembly difficulties caused by interstrain variation in complex microbial communities, enabling inference of ecosystem functions for uncultured members.

The method is applied by plotting percentage cumulative abundance curves. This can reveal that some assemblages cannot be compared in terms of diversity or equitability and that intrinsic diversity indices cannot under these circumstances be relied upon. The behaviour and interpretation of these dominance curves under different circumstances is explored using examples from macrobenthic and marine nematode studies. Dominance curves are also compared with Sanders' rarefaction curves and the relative advantages discussed. It is recommended that these graphical methods be routinely applied to marine biological data before calculating more complex diversity or equitability indices.},

There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available, most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by the currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution. To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56 culturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced benefits (compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected from the existing database) in diverse areas including the reconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein families and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for known genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need for systematic 'phylogenomic' efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven 'Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea' in order to derive maximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from genome sequences to come.},

@misc{Zhang2014These,
    abstract = {K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in nucleotide
sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo assembly, repeat
detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the khmer software
package for fast and memory efficient online counting of k-mers in sequencing
data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data structures such as hash
tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer relies entirely on a simple
probabilistic data structure, a {Count-Min} Sketch. The {Count-Min} Sketch permits
online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to
support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data
structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure.
In exchange, the use of a {Count-Min} Sketch introduces a systematic overcount
for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we
analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for
generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for
individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other
k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, {BFCounter}, {DSK}, {KMC},
Turtle and {KAnalyze}. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling
sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads
in the context of high khmer false positive rates. khmer is implemented in C++
wrapped in a Python interface, offers a tested and robust {API}, and is freely
available under the {BSD} license at github.com/ged-lab/khmer.},

@article{Kua2012Referencefree,
    abstract = {Direct analysis of unassembled genomic data could greatly increase the power of short read {DNA} sequencing technologies and allow comparative genomics of organisms without a completed reference available. Here, we compare 174 chloroplasts by analyzing the taxanomic distribution of short kmers across genomes [1]. We then assemble de novo contigs centered on informative variation. The localized de novo contigs can be separated into two major classes: tip = unique to a single genome and group = shared by a subset of genomes. Prior to assembly, we found that \~{}18\% of the chloroplast was duplicated in the inverted repeat ({IR}) region across a four-fold difference in genome sizes, from a highly reduced parasitic orchid [2] to a massive algal chloroplast [3], including gnetophytes [4] and cycads [5]. The conservation of this ratio between single copy and duplicated sequence was basal among green plants, independent of photosynthesis and mechanism of genome size change, and different in gymnosperms and lower plants. Major lineages in the angiosperm clade differed in the pattern of shared kmers and de novo contigs. For example, parasitic plants demonstrated an expected accelerated overall rate of evolution, while the hemi-parasitic genomes contained a great deal more novel sequence than holo-parasitic plants, suggesting different mechanisms at different stages of genomic contraction. Additionally, the legumes are diverging more quickly and in different ways than other major families. Small duplicated fragments of the rrn23 genes were deeply conserved among seed plants, including among several species without the {IR} regions, indicating a crucial functional role of this duplication. Localized de novo assembly of informative kmers greatly reduces the complexity of large comparative analyses by confining the analysis to a small partition of data and genomes relevant to the specific question, allowing direct analysis of next-gen sequence data from previously unstudied genomes and rapid discovery of informative candidate regions.},

@article{Namiki2012MetaVelvet,
    abstract = {An important step in 'metagenomics' analysis is the assembly of multiple genomes from mixed sequence reads of multiple species in a microbial community. Most conventional pipelines use a single-genome assembler with carefully optimized parameters. A limitation of a single-genome assembler for de novo metagenome assembly is that sequences of highly abundant species are likely misidentified as repeats in a single genome, resulting in a number of small fragmented scaffolds. We extended a single-genome assembler for short reads, known as 'Velvet', to metagenome assembly, which we called '{MetaVelvet}', for mixed short reads of multiple species. Our fundamental concept was to first decompose a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs, and second, to build scaffolds based on each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph as an isolate species genome. We made use of two features, the coverage (abundance) difference and graph connectivity, for the decomposition of the de Bruijn graph. For simulated datasets, {MetaVelvet} succeeded in generating significantly higher N50 scores than any single-genome assemblers. {MetaVelvet} also reconstructed relatively low-coverage genome sequences as scaffolds. On real datasets of human gut microbial read data, {MetaVelvet} produced longer scaffolds and increased the number of predicted genes.},

@article{Handley2014Complete,
    abstract = {We reconstructed the complete 2.4 Mb-long genome of a previously uncultivated epsilonproteobacterium, Candidatus Sulfuricurvum sp. {RIFRC}-1, via assembly of short-read shotgun metagenomic data using a complexity reduction approach. Genome-based comparisons indicate the bacterium is a novel species within the Sulfuricurvum genus, which contains one cultivated representative, S. kujiense. Divergence between the species appears due in part to extensive genomic rearrangements, gene loss and chromosomal versus plasmid encoding of certain (respiratory) genes by {RIFRC}-1. Deoxyribonucleic acid for the genome was obtained from terrestrial aquifer sediment, in which {RIFRC}-1 comprised ∼ 47\% of the bacterial community. Genomic evidence suggests {RIFRC}-1 is a chemolithoautotrophic diazotroph capable of deriving energy for growth by microaerobic or nitrate-/nitric oxide-dependent oxidation of S(0) , sulfide or sulfite or H2 oxidation. Carbon may be fixed via the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. Consistent with these physiological attributes, the local aquifer was microoxic with small concentrations of available nitrate, small but elevated concentrations of reduced sulfur and {NH4} (+) /{NH3} -limited. Additionally, various mechanisms for heavy metal and metalloid tolerance and virulence point to a lifestyle well-adapted for metal(loid)-rich environments and a shared evolutionary past with pathogenic Epsilonproteobacteria. Results expand upon recent findings highlighting the potential importance of sulfur and hydrogen metabolism in the terrestrial subsurface. {\copyright} 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

@article{Hooper2010Estimating,
    abstract = {Motivation: Shotgun sequencing generates large numbers of short {DNA} reads from either an isolated organism or, in the case of metagenomics projects, from the aggregate genome of a microbial community. These reads are then assembled based on overlapping sequences into larger, contiguous sequences (contigs). The feasibility of assembly and the coverage achieved (reads per nucleotide or distinct sequence of nucleotides) depend on several factors: the number of reads sequenced, the read length and the relative abundances of their source genomes in the microbial community. A low coverage suggests that most of the genomic {DNA} in the sample has not been sequenced, but it is often difficult to estimate either the extent of the uncaptured diversity or the amount of additional sequencing that would be most efficacious. In this work, we regard a metagenome as a population of {DNA} fragments (bins), each of which may be covered by one or more reads. We employ a gamma distribution to model this bin population due to its flexibility and ease of use. When a gamma approximation can be found that adequately fits the data, we may estimate the number of bins that were not sequenced and that could potentially be revealed by additional sequencing. We evaluated the performance of this model using simulated metagenomes and demonstrate its applicability on three recent metagenomic datasets.},

                One goal of sequencing-based metagenomic community analysis is the quantitative taxonomic assessment of microbial community compositions. In particular, relative quantification of taxons is of high relevance for metagenomic diagnostics or microbial community comparison. However, the majority of existing approaches quantify at low resolution (e.g. at phylum level), rely on the existence of special genes (e.g. {16S}), or have severe problems discerning species with highly similar genome sequences. Yet, problems as metagenomic diagnostics require accurate quantification on species level. We developed Genome Abundance Similarity Correction ({GASiC}), a method to estimate true genome abundances via read alignment by considering reference genome similarities in a non-negative {LASSO} approach. We demonstrate {GASiC}'s superior performance over existing methods on simulated benchmark data as well as on real data. In addition, we present applications to datasets of both bacterial {DNA} and viral {RNA} source. We further discuss our approach as an alternative to {PCR}-based {DNA} quantification.

This makes it difficult to determine a priori the amount of {DNA} sequencing necessary to obtain a high coverage for the dominant genomes in an environment. To aid the design of metagenomic sequencing projects, we have developed {COVER}, a web-based tool that allows the estimation of the coverage achieved for each species in an environmental sample. {COVER} uses a set of {16S} {rRNA} sequences to produce an estimate of the number of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) in the sample, provides a taxonomic assignment for them, estimates their genome sizes and, most critically, corrects for the number of unobserved {OTUs}. {COVER} then calculates the amount of sequencing needed to achieve a given goal. Our tests and simulations indicate that the results obtained through {COVER} are in very good agreement with the experimental results.},

                Determining the fraction of the diversity within a microbial community sampled and the amount of sequencing required to cover the total diversity represent challenging issues for metagenomics studies. Owing to these limitations, central ecological questions with respect to the global distribution of microbes and the functional diversity of their communities cannot be robustly assessed.
                We introduce Nonpareil, a method to estimate and project coverage in metagenomes. Nonpareil does not rely on high-quality assemblies, operational taxonomic unit calling or comprehensive reference databases; thus, it is broadly applicable to metagenomic studies. Application of Nonpareil on available metagenomic datasets provided estimates on the relative complexity of soil, freshwater and human microbiome communities, and suggested that ∼200 Gb of sequencing data are required for 95\% abundance-weighted average coverage of the soil communities analyzed.

@article{Miller_emirge,
    abstract = {
                In microbial ecology, a fundamental question relates to how community diversity and composition change in response to perturbation. Most studies have had limited ability to deeply sample community structure (e.g. Sanger-sequenced {16S} {rRNA} libraries), or have had limited taxonomic resolution (e.g. studies based on {16S} {rRNA} hypervariable region sequencing). Here, we combine the higher taxonomic resolution of near-full-length {16S} {rRNA} gene amplicons with the economics and sensitivity of short-read sequencing to assay the abundance and identity of organisms that represent as little as 0.01\% of sediment bacterial communities. We used a new version of {EMIRGE} optimized for large data size to reconstruct near-full-length {16S} {rRNA} genes from amplicons sheared and sequenced with Illumina technology. The approach allowed us to differentiate the community composition among samples acquired before perturbation, after acetate amendment shifted the predominant metabolism to iron reduction, and once sulfate reduction began. Results were highly reproducible across technical replicates, and identified specific taxa that responded to the perturbation. All samples contain very high alpha diversity and abundant organisms from phyla without cultivated representatives. Surprisingly, at the time points measured, there was no strong loss of evenness, despite the selective pressure of acetate amendment and change in the terminal electron accepting process. However, community membership was altered significantly. The method allows for sensitive, accurate profiling of the "long tail" of low abundance organisms that exist in many microbial communities, and can resolve population dynamics in response to environmental change.

@article{Kurtz2008,
    abstract = {The challenges of accurate gene prediction and enumeration are further aggravated in large genomes that contain highly repetitive transposable elements ({TEs}). Yet {TEs} play a substantial role in genome evolution and are themselves an important subject of study. Repeat annotation, based on counting occurrences of k-mers, has been previously used to distinguish {TEs} from low-copy genic regions; but currently available software solutions are impractical due to high memory requirements or specialization for specific user-tasks. Here we introduce the Tallymer software, a flexible and memory-efficient collection of programs for k-mer counting and indexing of large sequence sets. Unlike previous methods, Tallymer is based on enhanced suffix arrays. This gives a much larger flexibility concerning the choice of the k-mer size. Tallymer can process large data sizes of several billion bases. We used it in a variety of applications to study the genomes of maize and other plant species. In particular, Tallymer was used to index a set of whole genome shotgun sequences from maize (B73) (total size 109 bp.). We analyzed k-mer frequencies for a wide range of k. At this low genome coverage ( approximately 0.45x) highly repetitive 20-mers constituted 44\% of the genome but represented only 1\% of all possible k-mers. Similar low-complexity was seen in the repeat fractions of sorghum and rice. When applying our method to other maize data sets, {High-C0t} derived sequences showed the greatest enrichment for low-copy sequences. Among annotated {TEs}, the most highly repetitive were of the Ty3/gypsy class of retrotransposons, followed by the Ty1/copia class, and {DNA} transposons. Among expressed sequence tags ({EST}), a notable fraction contained high-copy k-mers, suggesting that transposons are still active in maize. Retrotransposons in Mo17 and {McC} cultivars were readily detected using the B73 20-mer frequency index, indicating their conservation despite extensive rearrangement across cultivars. Among one hundred annotated bacterial artificial chromosomes ({BACs}), k-mer frequency could be used to detect transposon-encoded genes with 92\% sensitivity, compared to 96\% using alignment-based repeat masking, while both methods showed 92\% specificity. The Tallymer software was effective in a variety of applications to aid genome annotation in maize, despite limitations imposed by the relatively low coverage of sequence available.

However, sequence bias in the initial cycles, which are used to determine the coordinates of individual clusters, causes a loss of fidelity in cluster identification on Illumina Genome Analysers. This can result in a significant reduction in the numbers of clusters that can be analysed. Such low sample diversity is an intrinsic problem of sequencing libraries that are generated by restriction enzyme digestion, such as {e4C}-seq or reduced-representation libraries. Similarly, this problem can also arise through the combined sequencing of barcoded, multiplexed libraries. We describe a procedure to defer the mapping of cluster coordinates until low-diversity sequences have been passed. This simple procedure can recover substantial amounts of next generation sequencing data that would otherwise be lost.},

    abstract = {Metagenomic studies characterize both the composition and diversity of uncultured viral and microbial communities. {BLAST}-based comparisons have typically been used for such analyses; however, sampling biases, high percentages of unknown sequences, and the use of arbitrary thresholds to find significant similarities can decrease the accuracy and validity of estimates. Here, we present Genome relative Abundance and Average Size ({GAAS}), a complete software package that provides improved estimates of community composition and average genome length for metagenomes in both textual and graphical formats. {GAAS} implements a novel methodology to control for sampling bias via length normalization, to adjust for multiple {BLAST} similarities by similarity weighting, and to select significant similarities using relative alignment lengths. In benchmark tests, the {GAAS} method was robust to both high percentages of unknown sequences and to variations in metagenomic sequence read lengths. Re-analysis of the Sargasso Sea virome using {GAAS} indicated that standard methodologies for metagenomic analysis may dramatically underestimate the abundance and importance of organisms with small genomes in environmental systems. Using {GAAS}, we conducted a meta-analysis of microbial and viral average genome lengths in over 150 metagenomes from four biomes to determine whether genome lengths vary consistently between and within biomes, and between microbial and viral communities from the same environment. Significant differences between biomes and within aquatic sub-biomes (oceans, hypersaline systems, freshwater, and microbialites) suggested that average genome length is a fundamental property of environments driven by factors at the sub-biome level. The behavior of paired viral and microbial metagenomes from the same environment indicated that microbial and viral average genome sizes are independent of each other, but indicative of community responses to stressors and environmental conditions. Metagenomics uses {DNA} or {RNA} sequences isolated directly from the environment to determine what viruses or microorganisms exist in natural communities and what metabolic activities they encode. Typically, metagenomic sequences are compared to annotated sequences in public databases using the {BLAST} search tool. Our methods, implemented in the Genome relative Abundance and Average Size ({GAAS}) software, improve the way {BLAST} searches are processed to estimate the taxonomic composition of communities and their average genome length. {GAAS} provides a more accurate picture of community composition by correcting for a systematic sampling bias towards larger genomes, and is useful in situations where organisms with small genomes are abundant, such as disease outbreaks caused by small {RNA} viruses. Microbial average genome length relates to environmental complexity and the distribution of genome lengths describes community diversity. A study of the average genome length of viruses and microorganisms in four different biomes using {GAAS} on 169 metagenomes showed significantly different average genome sizes between biomes, and large variability within biomes as well. This also revealed that microbial and viral average genome sizes in the same environment are independent of each other, which reflects the different ways that microorganisms and viruses respond to stress and environmental conditions.},

    abstract = {We present a whole-proteome phylogeny of prokaryotes constructed by comparing feature frequency profiles ({FFPs}) of whole proteomes. Features are l-mers of amino acids, and each organism is represented by a profile of frequencies of all features. The selection of feature length is critical in the {FFP} method, and we have developed a procedure for identifying the optimal feature lengths for inferring the phylogeny of prokaryotes, strictly speaking, a proteome phylogeny. Our {FFP} trees are constructed with whole proteomes of 884 prokaryotes, 16 unicellular eukaryotes, and 2 random sequences. To highlight the branching order of major groups, we present a simplified proteome {FFP} tree of monophyletic class or phylum with branch support. In our whole-proteome {FFP} trees (i) Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and a random sequence outgroup are clearly separated; (ii) Archaea and Bacteria form a sister group when rooted with random sequences; (iii) Planctomycetes, which possesses an intracellular membrane compartment, is placed at the basal position of the Bacteria domain; (iv) almost all groups are monophyletic in prokaryotes at most taxonomic levels, but many differences in the branching order of major groups are observed between our proteome {FFP} tree and trees built with other methods; and (v) previously  ” unclassified” genomes may be assigned to the most likely taxa. We describe notable similarities and differences between our {FFP} trees and those based on other methods in grouping and phylogeny of prokaryotes.},

@article{Liese2006Divergences,
    abstract = {The paper deals with the f-divergences of Csiszar generalizing the discrimination information of Kullback, the total variation distance, the Hellinger divergence, and the Pearson divergence. All basic properties of f-divergences including relations to the decision errors are proved in a new manner replacing the classical Jensen inequality by a new generalized Taylor expansion of convex functions. Some new properties are proved too, e.g., relations to the statistical sufficiency and deficiency. The generalized Taylor expansion also shows very easily that all f-divergences are average statistical informations (differences between prior and posterior Bayes errors) mutually differing only in the weights imposed on various prior distributions. The statistical information introduced by De Groot and the classical information of Shannon are shown to be extremal cases corresponding to alpha=0 and alpha=1 in the class of the so-called Arimoto alpha-informations introduced in this paper for 0<alpha<1 by means of the Arimoto alpha-entropies. Some new examples of f-divergences are introduced as well, namely, the Shannon divergences and the Arimoto alpha-divergences leading for alphauarr1 to the Shannon divergences. Square roots of all these divergences are shown to be metrics satisfying the triangle inequality. The last section introduces statistical tests and estimators based on the minimal f-divergence with the empirical distribution achieved in the families of hypothetic distributions. For the Kullback divergence this leads to the classical likelihood ratio test and estimator},

                De novo repeat family identification is a challenging algorithmic problem of great practical importance. As the number of genome sequencing projects increases, there is a pressing need to identify the repeat families present in large, newly sequenced genomes. We develop a new method for de novo identification of repeat families via extension of consensus seeds; our method enables a rigorous definition of repeat boundaries, a key issue in repeat analysis.
                Our {RepeatScout} algorithm is more sensitive and is orders of magnitude faster than {RECON}, the dominant tool for de novo repeat family identification in newly sequenced genomes. Using {RepeatScout}, we estimate that approximately 2\% of the human genome and 4\% of mouse and rat genomes consist of previously unannotated repetitive sequence.

                Compared with traditional algorithms for long metagenomic sequence classification, characterizing microorganisms' taxonomic and functional abundance based on tens of millions of very short reads are much more challenging. We describe an efficient composition and phylogeny-based algorithm [Metagenome Composition Vector ({MetaCV})] to classify very short metagenomic reads (75-100 bp) into specific taxonomic and functional groups. We applied {MetaCV} to the {Meta-HIT} data ({371-Gb} 75-bp reads of 109 human gut metagenomes), and this single-read-based, instead of assembly-based, classification has a high resolution to characterize the composition and structure of human gut microbiota, especially for low abundance species. Most strikingly, it only took {MetaCV} 10 days to do all the computation work on a server with five 24-core nodes. To our knowledge, {MetaCV}, benefited from the strategy of composition comparison, is the first algorithm that can classify millions of very short reads within affordable time.

@article{Wan2010Alignmentfree,
    abstract = {
                Rapid methods for alignment-free sequence comparison make large-scale comparisons between sequences increasingly feasible. Here we study the power of the statistic D2, which counts the number of matching k-tuples between two sequences, as well as D2*, which uses centralized counts, and {D2S}, which is a self-standardized version, both from a theoretical viewpoint and numerically, providing an easy to use program. The power is assessed under two alternative hidden Markov models; the first one assumes that the two sequences share a common motif, whereas the second model is a pattern transfer model; the null model is that the two sequences are composed of independent and identically distributed letters and they are independent. Under the first alternative model, the means of the tuple counts in the individual sequences change, whereas under the second alternative model, the marginal means are the same as under the null model. Using the limit distributions of the count statistics under the null and the alternative models, we find that generally, asymptotically {D2S} has the largest power, followed by D2*, whereas the power of D2 can even be zero in some cases. In contrast, even for sequences of length 140,000 bp, in simulations D2* generally has the largest power. Under the first alternative model of a shared motif, the power of D2*approaches 100\% when sufficiently many motifs are shared, and we recommend the use of D2* for such practical applications. Under the second alternative model of pattern transfer,the power for all three count statistics does not increase with sequence length when the sequence is sufficiently long, and hence none of the three statistics under consideration canbe recommended in such a situation. We illustrate the approach on 323 transcription factor binding motifs with length at most 10 from {JASPAR} {CORE} (October 12, 2009 version),verifying that D2* is generally more powerful than D2. The program to calculate the power of D2, D2* and {D2S} can be downloaded from http://meta.cmb.usc.edu/d2. Supplementary Material is available at www.liebertonline.com/cmb.

    abstract = {
                Large-scale comparison of the similarities between two biological sequences is a major issue in computational biology; a fast method, the D(2) statistic, relies on the comparison of the k-tuple content for both sequences. Although it has been known for some years that the D(2) statistic is not suitable for this task, as it tends to be dominated by single-sequence noise, to date no suitable adjustments have been proposed. In this article, we suggest two new variants of the D(2) word count statistic, which we call {D(2)(S}) and D(2)(*). For {D(2)(S}), which is a self-standardized statistic, we show that the statistic is asymptotically normally distributed, when sequence lengths tend to infinity, and not dominated by the noise in the individual sequences. The second statistic, D(2)(*), outperforms {D(2)(S}) in terms of power for detecting the relatedness between the two sequences in our examples; but although it is straightforward to simulate from the asymptotic distribution of D(2)(*), we cannot provide a closed form for power calculations.

                Alignment-free sequence comparison methods are still in the early stages of development compared to those of alignment-based sequence analysis. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic measure of similarity between two biological sequences without alignment. The method is based on the concept of comparing the similarity/dissimilarity between two constructed Markov models.
                The method was tested against six {DNA} sequences, which are the {thrA}, {thrB} and {thrC} genes of the threonine operons from Escherichia coli K-12 and from Shigella flexneri; and one random sequence having the same base composition as {thrA} from E.coli. These results were compared with those obtained from {CLUSTAL} W algorithm (alignment-based) and the chaos game representation (alignment-free). The method was further tested against a more complex set of 40 {DNA} sequences and compared with other existing sequence similarity measures (alignment-free).

@article{2003vinga,
    abstract = {Genetic recombination and, in particular, genetic shuffling are at odds with sequence comparison by alignment, which assumes conservation of contiguity between homologous segments. A variety of theoretical foundations are being used to derive alignment-free methods that overcome this limitation. The formulation of alternative metrics for dissimilarity between sequences and their algorithmic implementations are reviewed. The overwhelming majority of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. Two main categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer) frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequence with fixed word length segments. The first category is based on the statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian space defined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content of frequency distribution. The second category includes the use of Kolmogorov complexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility, alignment-free metrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection filters for alignment-based querying of large applications. Recent work is furthering their usage as a scale-independent methodology that is capable of recognizing homology when loss of contiguity is beyond the possibility of alignment. Most of the alignment-free algorithms reviewed were implemented in {MATLAB} code and are available at http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.html},

@article{Gruenheit2012Cutoffs,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Transcriptome analysis is increasingly being used to study the evolutionary origins and ecology of non-model plants. One issue for both transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression analyses is the common occurrence in plants of hybridisation and whole genome duplication ({WGD}) and hybridization resulting in allopolyploidy. The divergence of duplicated genes following {WGD} creates near identical homeologues that can be problematic for de novo assembly and also reference based assembly protocols that use short reads (35 - 100 {bp).RESULTS}:Here we report a successful strategy for the assembly of two transcriptomes made using 75 bp Illumina reads from Pachycladon fastigiatum and Pachycladon cheesemanii. Both are allopolyploid plant species (2n = 20) that originated in the New Zealand Alps about 0.8 million years ago. In a systematic analysis of 19 different coverage cutoffs and 20 different k-mer sizes we showed that i) none of the genes could be assembled across all of the parameter space ii) assembly of each gene required an optimal set of parameter values and iii) these parameter values could be explained in part by different gene expression levels and different degrees of similarity between {genes.CONCLUSIONS}:To obtain optimal transcriptome assemblies for allopolyploid plants, k-mer size and k-mer coverage need to be considered simultaneously across a broad parameter space. This is important for assembling a maximum number of full length {ESTs} and for avoiding chimeric assemblies of homeologous and paralogous gene copies.},

These new technologies have specific characteristics and limitations that require either consideration during project design, or which must be addressed during data analysis. Specialist skills, both at the laboratory and the computational stages of project design and analysis, are crucial to the generation of high quality data from these new platforms. The Illumina sequencers (including the Genome Analyzers {I/II}/{IIe}/{IIx} and the new {HiScan} and {HiSeq}) represent a widely used platform providing parallel readout of several hundred million immobilized sequences using fluorescent-dye reversible-terminator chemistry. Sequencing library quality, sample handling, instrument settings and sequencing chemistry have a strong impact on sequencing run quality. The presence of adapter chimeras and adapter sequences at the end of short-insert molecules, as well as increased error rates and short read lengths complicate many computational analyses. We discuss here some of the factors that influence the frequency and severity of these problems and provide solutions for circumventing these. Further, we present a set of general principles for good analysis practice that enable problems with sequencing runs to be identified and dealt with.},

                {MOTIVATION}: As more and more whole genomes are available, there is a need for new methods to compare large sequences and transfer biological knowledge from annotated genomes to related new ones. {BLAST} is not suitable to compare multimegabase {DNA} sequences. {MegaBLAST} is designed to compare closely related large sequences. Some tools to detect repeats in large sequences have already been developed such as {MUMmer} or {REPuter}. They also have time or space restrictions. Moreover, in terms of applications, {REPuter} only computes repeats and {MUMmer} works better with related genomes. {RESULTS}: We present a heuristic method, named {FORRepeats}, which is based on a novel data structure called factor oracle. In the first step it detects exact repeats in large sequences. Then, in the second step, it computes approximate repeats and performs pairwise comparison. We compared its computational characteristics with {BLAST} and {REPuter}. Results demonstrate that it is fast and space economical. We show {FORRepeats} ability to perform intra-genomic comparison and to detect repeated {DNA} sequences in the complete genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

@article{Majoros05TWAIN,
    abstract = {
                The increased availability of genome sequences of closely related organisms has generated much interest in utilizing homology to improve the accuracy of gene prediction programs. Generalized pair hidden Markov models ({GPHMMs}) have been proposed as one means to address this need. However, all {GPHMM} implementations currently available are either closed-source or the details of their operation are not fully described in the literature, leaving a significant hurdle for others wishing to advance the state of the art in {GPHMM} design.
                We have developed an open-source {GPHMM} gene finder, {TWAIN}, which performs very well on two related Aspergillus species, A.fumigatus and A.nidulans, finding 89\% of the exons and predicting 74\% of the gene models exactly correctly in a test set of 147 conserved gene pairs. We describe the implementation of this {GPHMM} and we explicitly address the assumptions and limitations of the system. We suggest possible ways of relaxing those assumptions to improve the utility of the system without sacrificing efficiency beyond what is practical.

    abstract = {
                Gene recognition is essential to understanding existing and future {DNA} sequence data. {CRITICA} (Coding Region Identification Tool Invoking Comparative Analysis) is a suite of programs for identifying likely protein-coding sequences in {DNA} by combining comparative analysis of {DNA} sequences with more common noncomparative methods. In the comparative component of the analysis, regions of {DNA} are aligned with related sequences from the {DNA} databases; if the translation of the aligned sequences has greater amino acid identity than expected for the observed percentage nucleotide identity, this is interpreted as evidence for coding. {CRITICA} also incorporates noncomparative information derived from the relative frequencies of hexanucleotides in coding frames versus other contexts (i.e., dicodon bias). The dicodon usage information is derived by iterative analysis of the data, such that {CRITICA} is not dependent on the existence or accuracy of coding sequence annotations in the databases. This independence makes the method particularly well suited for the analysis of novel genomes. {CRITICA} was tested by analyzing the available Salmonella typhimurium {DNA} sequences. Its predictions were compared with the {DNA} sequence annotations and with the predictions of {GenMark}. {CRITICA} proved to be more accurate than {GenMark}, and moreover, many of its predictions that would seem to be errors instead reflect problems in the sequence databases. The source code of {CRITICA} is freely available by anonymous {FTP} (rdp.life.uiuc.edu in/pub/critica) and on the World Wide Web (http:/(/)rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu).

Illumina's Genome Analyzer ({GA}) and {HiSeq} instruments are currently the most widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively evaluate properties of genomic {HiSeq} and {GAIIx} data derived from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95 to 150 {bases.RESULTS}:We provide quantifications and evidence for {GC} bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5\% of alignable bases. While overall error rates are low in {HiSeq} data we observed regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution errors. Analyzing the forward and reverse strands separately revealed error rates of up to 18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and {GC} content was found depending on the {GC} content {range.CONCLUSIONS}:The errors and biases we report have implications for the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing data. {GAIIx} and {HiSeq} data sets show slightly different error profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance polymorphisms.},

    abstract = {The availability of massive amounts of {DNA} sequence information has begun to revolutionize the practice of biology. As a result, current large-scale sequencing output, while impressive, is not adequate to keep pace with growing demand and, in particular, is far short of what will be required to obtain the 3-billion-base human genome sequence by the target date of 2005. To reach this goal, improved automation will be essential, and it is particularly important that human involvement in sequence data processing be significantly reduced or eliminated. Progress in this respect will require both improved accuracy of the data processing software and reliable accuracy measures to reduce the need for human involvement in error correction and make human review more efficient. Here, we describe one step toward that goal: a base-calling program for automated sequencer traces,phred, with improved accuracy. phred appears to be the first base-calling program to achieve a lower error rate than the {ABI} software, averaging 40\%–50\% fewer errors in the data sets examined independent of position in read, machine running conditions, or sequencing chemistry.},

We abandon the classical  ” overlap–layout–consensus” approach in favor of a new euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the 20-year-old  ” repeat problem” in fragment assembly. Our main result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},

@article{Phillips1987_HexamersEcoli,
    abstract = {Several statistical methods were tested for accuracy in predicting observed frequencies of di- through hexanucleotides in 74,444 bp of E. coli {DNA}. A Markov chain was most accurate overall, whereas other methods, including a random model based on mononucleotide frequencies, were very inaccurate. When ranked highest to lowest abundance, the observed frequencies of oligonucleotides up to six bases in length in E. coli {DNA} were highly asymmetric. All ordered abundance plots had a wide linear range containing the majority of the oligomers which deviated sharply at the high and low ends of the curves. In general, values predicted by a Markov chain closely followed the overall shape of the ordered abundance curves. A simple equation was derived by which the frequency of any nucleotide longer than four bases in the E. coli genome (or any genome) can be relatively accurately estimated from the nested set of component tri- and tetranucleotides by serial application of a 3rd order Markov chain. The equation yielded a mean ratio of 1.03 +/- 0.94 for the observed-to-expected frequencies of the 4,096 hexanucleotides. Hence, the method is a relatively accurate but not perfect predictor of the length in nucleotides between hexanucleotide sites. Higher accuracy can be achieved using a 4th order Markov chain and larger data sets. The high asymmetry in oligonucleotide abundance means that in the E. coli genome of 4.2 X 10(6) bp many relatively short sequences of 7-9 bp are very rare or absent.},

@article{Wu20022_AbundanceBin,
    abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities sampled directly from their natural environment, without prior culturing. Among the computational tools recently developed for metagenomic sequence analysis, binning tools attempt to classify the sequences in a metagenomic dataset into different bins (i.e., species), based on various {DNA} composition patterns (e.g., the tetramer frequencies) of various genomes. Composition-based binning methods, however, cannot be used to classify very short fragments, because of the substantial variation of {DNA} composition patterns within a single genome. We developed a novel approach ({AbundanceBin}) for metagenomics binning by utilizing the different abundances of species living in the same environment. {AbundanceBin} is an application of the {Lander-Waterman} model to metagenomics, which is based on the l-tuple content of the reads. {AbundanceBin} achieved accurate, unsupervised, clustering of metagenomic sequences into different bins, such that the reads classified in a bin belong to species of identical or very similar abundances in the sample. In addition, {AbundanceBin} gave accurate estimations of species abundances, as well as their genome sizes-two important parameters for characterizing a microbial community. We also show that {AbundanceBin} performed well when the sequence lengths are very short (e.g., 75 bp) or have sequencing errors. By combining {AbundanceBin} and a composition-based method ({MetaCluster}), we can achieve even higher binning accuracy. Supplementary Material is available at www.liebertonline.com/cmb .},

One main challenge facing metagenomic analysis is phylogenetic classification of raw sequence reads into groups representing the same or similar taxa, a prerequisite for genome assembly and for analyzing the biological diversity of a sample. New sequencing technologies have made metagenomics easier, by making sequencing faster, and more difficult, by producing shorter reads than previous technologies. Classifying sequences from reads as short as 100 base pairs has until now been relatively inaccurate, requiring researchers to use older, long-read technologies. We present Phymm, a classifier for metagenomic data, that has been trained on 539 complete, curated genomes and can accurately classify reads as short as 100 base pairs, a substantial improvement over previous composition-based classification methods. We also describe how combining Phymm with sequence alignment algorithms improves accuracy.},

@article{Monier2007_HGTanamoly,
    abstract = {{DNA} viruses have a wide range of genome sizes (5 kb up to 1.2 Mb, compared to 0.16 Mb to 1.5 Mb for obligate parasitic bacteria) that do not correlate with their virulence or the taxonomic distribution of their hosts. The reasons for such large variation are unclear. According to the traditional view of viruses as gifted "gene pickpockets", large viral genome sizes could originate from numerous gene acquisitions from their hosts. We investigated this hypothesis by studying 67 large {DNA} viruses with genome sizes larger than 150 kb, including the recently characterized giant mimivirus. Given that horizontally transferred {DNA} often have anomalous nucleotide compositions differing from the rest of the genome, we conducted a detailed analysis of the inter- and intra-genome compositional properties of these viruses. We then interpreted their compositional heterogeneity in terms of possible causes, including strand asymmetry, gene function/expression, and horizontal transfer.
                We first show that the global nucleotide composition and nucleotide word usage of viral genomes are species-specific and distinct from those of their hosts. Next, we identified compositionally anomalous ({cA}) genes in viral genomes, using a method based on Bayesian inference. The proportion of {cA} genes is highly variable across viruses and does not exhibit a significant correlation with genome size. The vast majority of the {cA} genes were of unknown function, lacking homologs in the databases. For genes with known homologs, we found a substantial enrichment of {cA} genes in specific functional classes for some of the viruses. No significant association was found between {cA} genes and compositional strand asymmetry. A possible exogenous origin for a small fraction of the {cA} genes could be confirmed by phylogenetic reconstruction.
                At odds with the traditional dogma, our results argue against frequent genetic transfers to large {DNA} viruses from their modern hosts. The large genome sizes of these viruses are not simply explained by an increased propensity to acquire foreign genes. This study also confirms that the anomalous nucleotide compositions of the {cA} genes is sometimes linked to particular biological functions or expression patterns, possibly leading to an overestimation of recent horizontal gene transfers.},

@article{Sims2009_aligmentfree,
    abstract = {For comparison of whole-genome (genic + nongenic) sequences, multiple sequence alignment of a few selected genes is not appropriate. One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or l-mer) frequency profiles ({FFP}) of whole genomes are used for comparison—a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of l-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum {FFP} method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized {FFP} method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the {FFP} derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phylogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions.},

    abstract = {The identification of repeat structure in eukaryotic genomes can be time-consuming and difficult because of the large amount of information ( approximately 3 x 10(9) bp) that needs to be processed and compared. We introduce a new approach based on exact word counts to evaluate, de novo, the repeat structure present within large eukaryotic genomes. This approach avoids sequence alignment and similarity search, two of the most time-consuming components of traditional methods for repeat identification. Algorithms were implemented to efficiently calculate exact counts for any length oligonucleotide in large genomes. Based on these oligonucleotide counts, oligonucleotide excess probability clouds, or "P-clouds," were constructed. P-clouds are composed of clusters of related oligonucleotides that occur, as a group, more often than expected by chance. After construction, P-clouds were mapped back onto the genome, and regions of high P-cloud density were identified as repetitive regions based on a sliding window approach. This efficient method is capable of analyzing the repeat content of the entire human genome on a single desktop computer in less than half a day, at least 10-fold faster than current approaches. The predicted repetitive regions strongly overlap with known repeat elements as well as other repetitive regions such as gene families, pseudogenes, and segmental duplicons. This method should be extremely useful as a tool for use in de novo identification of repeat structure in large newly sequenced genomes.},

@article{Marcais_jellyfish,
    abstract = {Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm. We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution. The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is {GPL} licensed. It is available for download at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish.},

We present memory efficient data structures and algorithms for assembly using the {FM}-index derived from the compressed {Burrows-Wheeler} transform, and a new assembler based on these called {SGA} (String Graph Assembler). We describe algorithms to error-correct, assemble, and scaffold large sets of sequence data. {SGA} uses the overlap-based string graph model of assembly, unlike most de novo assemblers that rely on de Bruijn graphs, and is simply parallelizable. We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of {SGA} on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 {GB} of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95\% of the reference genome (excluding contigs <200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, {SGA} provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.},

@article{Pevzner2001debrujn,
    abstract = {For the last twenty years fragment assembly was dominated by the \^{a}overlap - layout - consensus\^{a} algorithms that are used in all currently available assembly tools. However, the limits of these algorithms are being tested in the era of genomic sequencing and it is not clear whether they are the best choice for large-scale assemblies. Although the \^{a}overlap - layout - consensus\^{a} approach proved to be useful in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic assemblies: the existing algorithms make assembly errors even in bacterial genomes. We abandoned the \^{a}overlap - layout - consensus\^{a} approach in favour of a new Eulerian Superpath approach that outperforms the existing algorithms for genomic fragment assembly (Pevzner et al. 2001 {InProceedings} of the Fifth Annual International Conference on Computational Molecular Biology ({RECOMB}-01), 256\^{a}26). In this paper we describe our new {EULER}-{DB} algorithm that, similarly to the Celera assembler takes advantage of clone-end sequencing by using the double-barreled data. However, in contrast to the Celera assembler, {EULER}-{DB} does not mask repeats but uses them instead as a powerful tool for contig ordering. We also describe a new approach for the Copy Number Problem: {\^{a}How} many times a given repeat is present in the genome?\^{a}. For long nearly-perfect repeats this question is notoriously difficult and some copies of such repeats may be \^{a}lost\^{a} in genomic assemblies.

Many conventional algorithms for shotgun sequencing are based on the notion of pairwise fragment overlap.

@article{Arnoldhexamer,
    abstract = {Here we compare several methods for predicting oligonucleotide frequencies in 392 kb of yeast {DNA}. As in previous work on E. coli, a relatively simple equation based on tetranucleotide frequencies can be used in predicting the frequencies of longer oligonucleotides. For example, the mean of observed/expected abundances of 4,096 hexamers was 1.00 with a sample standard deviation of .18. This simple predictor arises by considering each base on the sense strand of yeast to depend only on the three bases 5' to it (a 3rd order Markov chain) and is more accurate in estimating oligonucleotide frequencies than other statistical methods examined. This equation is useful in predicting restriction enzyme fragment sizes, selecting restriction enzymes that cut preferentially in coding vs noncoding regions, and in constructing detailed physical maps of whole genomes. When ranked highest to lowest abundance, the observed frequencies of oligomers of a given length (up to 6 bases) are closely tracked by the predicted abundances of a 3rd or 4th order Markov chain. These ordered abundance curves have a power curve shape with a broad linear range with a sharp break at the top end of the curve. There is also a strong disparity between the most and least abundant oligomer with for example a 79-fold variation between the most and least abundant hexamer. The curves reveal a strong dependence of oligomer frequencies on base composition. Unlike E. Coli, there is no sharp downturn at the low end of the curves and hence, no class of oligomers rare relative to other oligomers of the same length.},

    abstract = {Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for de novo assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents {DNA} assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes.

@article{Keegan2012PlatformIndependent,
    abstract = {We provide a novel method, {DRISEE} (duplicate read inferred sequencing error estimation), to assess sequencing quality (alternatively referred to as  ” noise” or  ” error”) within and/or between sequencing samples. {DRISEE} provides positional error estimates that can be used to inform read trimming within a sample. It also provides global (whole sample) error estimates that can be used to identify samples with high or varying levels of sequencing error that may confound downstream analyses, particularly in the case of studies that utilize data from multiple sequencing samples. For shotgun metagenomic data, we believe that {DRISEE} provides estimates of sequencing error that are more accurate and less constrained by technical limitations than existing methods that rely on reference genomes or the use of scores (e.g. Phred). Here, {DRISEE} is applied to (non amplicon) data sets from both the 454 and Illumina platforms. The {DRISEE} error estimate is obtained by analyzing sets of artifactual duplicate reads ({ADRs}), a known by-product of both sequencing platforms. We present {DRISEE} as an open-source, platform-independent method to assess sequencing error in shotgun metagenomic data, and utilize it to discover previously uncharacterized error in de novo sequence data from the 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms. Sequence quality (referred to alternatively as the level of sequencing error or noise) is a primary concern to all sequence-dependent investigations. This is particularly true in the field of metagenomics where automated tools (e.g. annotation pipelines like {MG}-{RAST}) rely on high fidelity sequence data to derive meaningful biological inferences, and is exacerbated by the capacity of next generation sequencing platforms that continue to expand at a rate greater than Moore's law. We demonstrate that the most commonly utilized means to assess sequencing error exhibit severe limitations with respect to analysis of metagenomic data. Furthermore, we introduce a method ({DRISEE}) that accounts for these limitations through the application of a novel approach to assess sequencing error. {DRISEE}-based analyses reveal previously unobserved levels of sequencing error. {DRISEE} provides a platform independent measure of sequencing error that objectively assesses the quality of entire sequence samples. This assessment can be used to exclude low quality samples from computationally expensive analyses (e.g. annotation). It can also be used to evaluate the relative fidelity of analyses after they have been performed (e.g. annotation of error prone samples is less reliable than that of samples with low levels of sequencing error).},

@article{Antonov2010Genetack,
    abstract = {
                We describe a new program for ab initio frameshift detection in protein-coding nucleotide sequences. The task is to distinguish the same strand overlapping {ORFs} that occur in the sequence due to a presence of a frameshifted gene from the same strand overlapping {ORFs} that encompass true overlapping or adjacent genes. The {GeneTack} program uses a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) of genomic sequence with possibly frameshifted protein-coding regions. The Viterbi algorithm finds the maximum likelihood path that discriminates between true adjacent genes and those adjacent protein-coding regions that just appear to be separate entities due to frameshifts. Therefore, the program can identify spurious predictions made by a conventional gene-finding program misled by a frameshift. We tested {GeneTack} as well as two earlier developed programs {FrameD} and {FSFind} on 17 prokaryotic genomes with frameshifts introduced randomly into known genes. We observed that the average frameshift prediction accuracy of {GeneTack}, in terms of (Sn + Sp)/2 values, was higher by a significant margin than the accuracy of two other programs. In addition, we observed that the average accuracy of {GeneTack} is favorably compared with the accuracy of the {FSFind}-{BLAST} program that uses protein database search to verify predicted frameshifts, even though {GeneTack} does not use external evidence. {GeneTack} is freely available at {http://topaz.gatech.edu/GeneTack}/.

@article{Risso2011GCcontent,
    abstract = {Transcriptome sequencing ({RNA}-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof. We focus on biases related to {GC}-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific {GC}-content effects on {RNA}-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level {GC}-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different {RNA}-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package {EDASeq}. Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce {GC}-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of {RNA}-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

    abstract = {
                Although cholera has been present in Latin America since 1991, it had not been epidemic in Haiti for at least 100 years. Recently, however, there has been a severe outbreak of cholera in Haiti.
                We used third-generation single-molecule real-time {DNA} sequencing to determine the genome sequences of 2 clinical Vibrio cholerae isolates from the current outbreak in Haiti, 1 strain that caused cholera in Latin America in 1991, and 2 strains isolated in South Asia in 2002 and 2008. Using primary sequence data, we compared the genomes of these 5 strains and a set of previously obtained partial genomic sequences of 23 diverse strains of V. cholerae to assess the likely origin of the cholera outbreak in Haiti.
                Both single-nucleotide variations and the presence and structure of hypervariable chromosomal elements indicate that there is a close relationship between the Haitian isolates and variant V. cholerae El Tor O1 strains isolated in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. In contrast, analysis of genomic variation of the Haitian isolates reveals a more distant relationship with circulating South American isolates.
                The Haitian epidemic is probably the result of the introduction, through human activity, of a V. cholerae strain from a distant geographic source. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.).

@article{Gilles2011Accuracy,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The rapid evolution of 454 {GS}-{FLX} sequencing technology has not been accompanied by a reassessment of the quality and accuracy of the sequences obtained. Current strategies for decision-making and error-correction are based on an initial analysis by Huse et al. in 2007, for the older {GS20} system based on experimental sequences. We analyze here the quality of 454 sequencing data and identify factors playing a role in sequencing error, through the use of an extensive dataset for Roche control {DNA} {fragments.RESULTS}:We obtained a mean error rate for 454 sequences of 1.07\%. More importantly, the error rate is not randomly distributed; it occasionally rose to more than 50\% in certain positions, and its distribution was linked to several experimental variables. The main factors related to error are the presence of homopolymers, position in the sequence, size of the sequence and spatial localization in {PT} plates for insertion and deletion errors. These factors can be described by considering seven variables. No single variable can account for the error rate distribution, but most of the variation is explained by the combination of all seven {variables.CONCLUSIONS}:The pattern identified here calls for the use of internal controls and error-correcting base callers, to correct for errors, when available (e.g. when sequencing amplicons). For shotgun libraries, the use of both sequencing primers and deep coverage, combined with the use of random sequencing primer sites should partly compensate for even high error rates, although it may prove more difficult than previous thought to distinguish between low-frequency alleles and errors.},

                Thousands of genes have been painstakingly identified and characterized a few genes at a time. Many thousands more are being predicted by large scale {cDNA} and genomic sequencing projects, with levels of evidence ranging from supporting {mRNA} sequence and comparative genomics to computing ab initio models. This, coupled with the burgeoning scientific literature, makes it critical to have a comprehensive directory for genes and reference sequences for key genomes. The {NCBI} provides two resources, {LocusLink} and {RefSeq}, to meet these needs. {LocusLink} organizes information around genes to generate a central hub for accessing gene-specific information for fruit fly, human, mouse, rat and zebrafish. {RefSeq} provides reference sequence standards for genomes, transcripts and proteins; human, mouse and rat {mRNA} {RefSeqs}, and their corresponding proteins, are discussed here. Together, {RefSeq} and {LocusLink} provide a non-redundant view of genes and other loci to support research on genes and gene families, variation, gene expression and genome annotation. Additional information about {LocusLink} and {RefSeq} is available at {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink}/.

                {NCBI}'s Reference Sequence ({RefSeq}) database ({http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq}/) is a curated non-redundant collection of sequences representing genomes, transcripts and proteins. {RefSeq} records integrate information from multiple sources and represent a current description of the sequence, the gene and sequence features. The database includes over 5300 organisms spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses, with records for more than 5.5 x 10(6) proteins ({RefSeq} release 30). Feature annotation is applied by a combination of curation, collaboration, propagation from other sources and computation. We report here on the recent growth of the database, recent changes to feature annotations and record types for eukaryotic (primarily vertebrate) species and policies regarding species inclusion and genome annotation. In addition, we introduce {RefSeqGene}, a new initiative to support reporting variation data on a stable genomic coordinate system.

@article{Egan1959Operating,
    abstract = {With the theory of signal detectability as a framework, two psychophysical experiments were conducted in which each observation interval was well defined for the listener. Each interval contained noise, and it either did or did not (p=0.5) contain a signal (1000 cps, 0.5 sec in duration). In separate sessions of the first experiment, either the listener gave a yes‐no decision or he responded with a rating (1–4) after each observation interval. Operating characteristics were obtained with {E/N0} equal to 15.8. It is clear from the data that the trained listener can perform as well when he adopts the multiple criteria necessary for the rating method as when he adopts the single criterion required by the binary‐decision procedure. In the second experiment, only the rating method was used to determine the relation between d′ and {E/N0}. The resulting function, for d′ ⩽ 3.0, approximates straight line which passes through the origin and which has nearly the same slope as that obtained in other laboratories.},

@article{Allen2012Influence,
    abstract = {Metagenomic data sets were generated from samples collected along a coastal to open ocean transect between Southern California Bight and California Current waters during a seasonal upwelling event, providing an opportunity to examine the impact of episodic pulses of cold nutrient-rich water into surface ocean microbial communities. The data set consists of \~{}5.8 million predicted proteins across seven sites, from three different size classes: 0.1–0.8, 0.8–3.0 and 3.0–200.0 μm. Taxonomic and metabolic analyses suggest that sequences from the 0.1–0.8 μm size class correlated with their position along the upwelling mosaic. However, taxonomic profiles of bacteria from the larger size classes (0.8–200 μm) were less constrained by habitat and characterized by an increase in Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteria and double-stranded {DNA} viral sequences. Functional annotation of transmembrane proteins indicate that sites comprised of organisms with small genomes have an enrichment of transporters with substrate specificities for amino acids, iron and cadmium, whereas organisms with larger genomes have a higher percentage of transporters for ammonium and potassium. Eukaryotic-type glutamine synthetase ({GS}) {II} proteins were identified and taxonomically classified as viral, most closely related to the {GSII} in Mimivirus, suggesting that marine Mimivirus-like particles may have played a role in the transfer of {GSII} gene functions. Additionally, a Planctomycete bloom was sampled from one upwelling site providing a rare opportunity to assess the genomic composition of a marine Planctomycete population. The significant correlations observed between genomic properties, community structure and nutrient availability provide insights into habitat-driven dynamics among oligotrophic versus upwelled marine waters adjoining each other spatially.},

    abstract = {The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. We implemented {Burrows-Wheeler} Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with {Burrows-Wheeler} Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence {Alignment/Map}) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package. http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Protein similarity search--a key step to achieve annotation of protein-coding genes in these short reads, and identification of their biological functions--faces daunting challenges because of the very sizes of the short read datasets. We developed a fast protein similarity search tool {RAPSearch} that utilizes a reduced amino acid alphabet and suffix array to detect seeds of flexible length. For short reads (translated in 6 frames) we tested, {RAPSearch} achieved \~{}20-90 times speedup as compared to {BLASTX}. {RAPSearch} missed only a small fraction (\~{}1.3-3.2\%) of {BLASTX} similarity hits, but it also discovered additional homologous proteins (\~{}0.3-2.1\%) that {BLASTX} missed. By contrast, {BLAT}, a tool that is even slightly faster than {RAPSearch}, had significant loss of sensitivity as compared to {RAPSearch} and {BLAST}. {RAPSearch} is implemented as open-source software and is accessible at {http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/mg/RAPSearch}. It enables faster protein similarity search. The application of {RAPSearch} in metageomics has also been demonstrated.},

@article{Konstantinidis2004Trends,
    abstract = {Although the evolution process and ecological benefits of symbiotic species with small genomes are well understood, these issues remain poorly elucidated for free-living species with large genomes. We have compared 115 completed prokaryotic genomes by using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database to determine whether there are changes with genome size in the proportion of the genome attributable to particular cellular processes, because this may reflect both cellular and ecological strategies associated with genome expansion. We found that large genomes are disproportionately enriched in regulation and secondary metabolism genes and depleted in protein translation, {DNA} replication, cell division, and nucleotide metabolism genes compared to medium- and small-sized genomes. Furthermore, large genomes do not accumulate noncoding {DNA} or hypothetical {ORFs}, because the portion of the genome devoted to these functions remained constant with genome size. Traits other than genome size or strain-specific processes are reflected by the dispersion around the mean for cell functions that showed no correlation with genome size. For example, Archaea had significantly more genes in energy production, coenzyme metabolism, and the poorly characterized category, and fewer in cell membrane biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism than Bacteria. The trends we noted with genome size by using Clusters of Orthologous Groups were confirmed by our independent analysis with The Institute for Genomic Research's Comprehensive Microbial Resource and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes' Orthology annotation databases. These trends suggest that larger genome-sized species may dominate in environments where resources are scarce but diverse and where there is little penalty for slow growth, such as soil.},

    abstract = {To an approximation Chargaff's rule (\%A = \%T; \%G = \%C) applies to single-stranded {DNA}. In long sequences, not only complementary bases but also complementary oligonucleotides are present in approximately equal frequencies. This applies to all species studied. However, species usually differ in base composition. With the goal of understanding the evolutionary forces involved, I have compared the frequencies of trinucleotides in long sequences and their shuffled counterparts. Among the 32 complementary trinucleotide pairs there is a hierarchy of frequencies which is influenced both by base composition (not affected by shuffling the order of the bases) and by base order (affected by shuffling). The influence of base order is greatest in {DNA} of 50\% G + C and seems to reflect a more fundamental hierarchy of dinucleotide frequencies. Thus if {TpA} is at low frequency, all eight {TpA}-containing trinucleotides are at low frequency. Mammals and their viruses share similar hierarchies, with intra- and intergenomic differences being mainly associated with differences in base composition (percentage G + C). E. coli and, to a lesser extent, Drosophila melanogaster hierarchies differ from mammalian hierarchies; this is associated with differences both in base composition and in base order. It is proposed that Chargaff's rule applies to single-stranded {DNA} because there has been an evolutionary selection pressure favoring mutations that generate complementary oligonucleotides in close proximity, thus creating a potential to form stem-loops. These are dispersed throughout genomes and are rate-limiting in recombination. Differences in (G + C)\% between species would impair interspecies recombination by interfering with stem-loop interactions.},

    abstract = {The relative quantities of bases in {DNA} were determined chemically many years before sequencing technologies permitted direct counting of bases. Apparently unaware of the rich literature on the topic, bioinformaticists are today rediscovering the 'wheels' of Chargaff, Wyatt and other biochemists. It follows from Chargaff's second parity rule (\%A = \%T, \%G = \%C for single stranded {DNA}) that the symmetries observed for the two pairs of complementary mononucleotide bases, should also apply to the eight pairs of complementary dinucleotide bases, the thirty-two pairs of complementary trinucleotide bases, etc. This was made explicit by Prabhu in 1993 in a study of complete genomes and long genome segments from a wide range of taxa, and was rediscovered by Qi and Cuticchia in 2001 in a study of complete genomes. It follows from Chargaff's {GC}-rule (\%{GC} tends to be uniform and species specific) that, within a species, oligonucleotides of the same {GC}\% will be at approximately equal quantities in single stranded {DNA}. Thus, for example, while quantities of {CAT} and {ATG} (reverse complements) will be closely correlated because of both of the above Chargaff rules, {CAT} and {GTA} (forward complements) will show some correlation only because of the latter rule. The need for complete genomic sequences in bioinformatic analyses may have been somewhat overplayed.},

@article{Niu2010Artificial,
    abstract = {Background
                              Artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads may lead to incorrect interpretation of the abundance of species and genes in metagenomic studies. Duplicated reads were filtered out in many metagenomic projects. However, since the duplicated reads observed in a pyrosequencing run also include natural (non-artificial) duplicates, simply removing all duplicates may also cause underestimation of abundance associated with natural duplicates.
                            
                              Results
                              We implemented a method for identification of exact and nearly identical duplicates from pyrosequencing reads. This method performs an all-against-all sequence comparison and clusters the duplicates into groups using an algorithm modified from our previous sequence clustering method cd-hit. This method can process a typical dataset in \~{}10 minutes; it also provides a consensus sequence for each group of duplicates. We applied this method to the underlying raw reads of 39 genomic projects and 10 metagenomic projects that utilized pyrosequencing technique. We compared the occurrences of the duplicates identified by our method and the natural duplicates made by independent simulations. We observed that the duplicates, including both artificial and natural duplicates, make up 4-44\% of reads. The number of natural duplicates highly correlates with the samples' read density (number of reads divided by genome size). For high-complexity metagenomic samples lacking dominant species, natural duplicates only make up <1\% of all duplicates. But for some other samples like transcriptomic samples, majority of the observed duplicates might be natural duplicates.
                            
                              Conclusions
                              Our method is available from http://cd-hit.org as a downloadable program and a web server. It is important not only to identify the duplicates from metagenomic datasets but also to distinguish whether they are artificial or natural duplicates. We provide a tool to estimate the number of natural duplicates according to user-defined sample types, so users can decide whether to retain or remove duplicates in their projects.},

@article{Bravo2010ModelBased,
    abstract = {Summary Second-generation sequencing (sec-gen) technology can sequence millions of short fragments of {DNA} in parallel, making it capable of assembling complex genomes for a small fraction of the price and time of previous technologies. In fact, a recently formed international consortium, the 1000 Genomes Project, plans to fully sequence the genomes of approximately 1200 people. The prospect of comparative analysis at the sequence level of a large number of samples across multiple populations may be achieved within the next five years. These data present unprecedented challenges in statistical analysis. For instance, analysis operates on millions of short nucleotide sequences, or reads—strings of {A,C},G, or T's, between 30 and 100 characters long—which are the result of complex processing of noisy continuous fluorescence intensity measurements known as base-calling. The complexity of the base-calling discretization process results in reads of widely varying quality within and across sequence samples. This variation in processing quality results in infrequent but systematic errors that we have found to mislead downstream analysis of the discretized sequence read data. For instance, a central goal of the 1000 Genomes Project is to quantify across-sample variation at the single nucleotide level. At this resolution, small error rates in sequencing prove significant, especially for rare variants. Sec-gen sequencing is a relatively new technology for which potential biases and sources of obscuring variation are not yet fully understood. Therefore, modeling and quantifying the uncertainty inherent in the generation of sequence reads is of utmost importance. In this article, we present a simple model to capture uncertainty arising in the base-calling procedure of the {Illumina/Solexa} {GA} platform. Model parameters have a straightforward interpretation in terms of the chemistry of base-calling allowing for informative and easily interpretable metrics that capture the variability in sequencing quality. Our model provides these informative estimates readily usable in quality assessment tools while significantly improving base-calling performance.},

@article{Kunin2010Wrinkles,
    abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit ({16S}) ribosomal {RNA} gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of {16S} {rDNA} amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli {MG1655} as a reference template, we find that {16S} {rDNA} diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of {16S} pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

                Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections. A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain {PAO1}. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances.

Strain {PAO1}, a derivative of the original Australian {PAO} isolate, has been distributed worldwide to laboratories and strain collections. Over decades discordant phenotypes of {PAO1} sublines have emerged. Taking the existing {PAO1}-{UW} genome sequence (named after the University of Washington, which led the sequencing project) as a blueprint, the genome sequences of reference strains {MPAO1} and {PAO1}-{DSM} (stored at the German Collection for Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [{DSMZ}]) were resolved by physical mapping and deep short read sequencing-by-synthesis. {MPAO1} has been the source of near-saturation libraries of transposon insertion mutants, and {PAO1}-{DSM} is identical in its {SpeI}-{DpnI} restriction map with the original isolate. The major genomic differences of {MPAO1} and {PAO1}-{DSM} in comparison to {PAO1}-{UW} are the lack of a large inversion, a duplication of a mobile 12-kb prophage region carrying a distinct integrase and protein phosphatases or kinases, deletions of 3 to 1,006 bp in size, and at least 39 single-nucleotide substitutions, 17 of which affect protein sequences. The {PAO1} sublines differed in their ability to cope with nutrient limitation and their virulence in an acute murine airway infection model. Subline {PAO1}-{DSM} outnumbered the two other sublines in late stationary growth phase. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa {PAO1} shows an ongoing microevolution of genotype and phenotype that jeopardizes the reproducibility of research. High-throughput genome resequencing will resolve more cases and could become a proper quality control for strain collections.},

To determine whether the short (∼100 to 200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for the phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities, the results of {BLAST} and {COG} analyses were compared for long (∼750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, {BLASTX} searches against the {GenBank} nr database found far fewer homologs within the short-sequence libraries. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short-read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in {BLASTX} homolog detection. Only in cases where the long-read sequence had a close homolog (low {BLAST} E-score) did the derived short-read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more-distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short-read sequences. Among {COG} hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72\% of the {COG} hits found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for the analysis of short sequences, the use of short-read-length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for the metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.},

    abstract = {Different high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing platforms are currently available but a trade-off currently exists between the cost and number of reads that can be generated versus the read length that can be achieved. We describe an experimental and computational pipeline yielding millions of reads that can exceed 200 bp with quality scores approaching that of traditional Sanger sequencing. The method combines an automatable gel-less library construction step with paired-end sequencing on a short-read instrument. With appropriately sized library inserts, mate-pair sequences can overlap, and we describe the {SHERA} software package that joins them to form a longer composite read. This strategy is broadly applicable to sequencing applications that benefit from low-cost high-throughput sequencing, but require longer read lengths. We demonstrate that our approach enables metagenomic analyses using the Illumina Genome Analyzer, with low error rates, and at a fraction of the cost of pyrosequencing.},

The amount of sequence in such datasets is usually insufficient for assembly, and traditional gene prediction cannot be applied to unassembled short reads. As a result, analysis of such datasets usually involves comparisons in terms of relative abundances of various protein families. The latter requires assignment of individual reads to protein families, which is hindered by the fact that short reads contain only a fragment, usually small, of a protein.},

@article{Cahill2010Read,
    abstract = {There are a growing number of next-generation sequencing technologies. At present, the most cost-effective options also produce the shortest reads. However, even for prokaryotes, there is uncertainty concerning the utility of these technologies for the de novo assembly of complete genomes. This reflects an expectation that short reads will be unable to resolve small, but presumably abundant, repeats. Using a simple model of repeat assembly, we develop and test a technique that, for any read length, can estimate the occurrence of unresolvable repeats in a genome, and thus predict the number of gaps that would need to be closed to produce a complete sequence. We apply this technique to 818 prokaryote genome sequences. This provides a quantitative assessment of the relative performance of various lengths. Notably, unpaired reads of only 150nt can reconstruct approximately 50\% of the analysed genomes with fewer than 96 repeat-induced gaps. Nonetheless, there is considerable variation amongst prokaryotes. Some genomes can be assembled to near contiguity using very short reads while others require much longer reads. Given the diversity of prokaryote genomes, a sequencing strategy should be tailored to the organism under study. Our results will provide researchers with a practical resource to guide the selection of the appropriate read length.},

@article{Hyatt2010Prodigal,
    abstract = {
                The quality of automated gene prediction in microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past decade, but there is still room for improvement. Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals.
                With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal ({PROkaryotic} {DYnamic} programming Gene-finding {ALgorithm}). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.
                We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.

Cow rumen microbes specialize in degradation of cellulosic plant material, but most members of this complex community resist cultivation. To characterize biomass-degrading genes and genomes, we sequenced and analyzed 268 gigabases of metagenomic {DNA} from microbes adherent to plant fiber incubated in cow rumen. From these data, we identified 27,755 putative carbohydrate-active genes and expressed 90 candidate proteins, of which 57\% were enzymatically active against cellulosic substrates. We also assembled 15 uncultured microbial genomes, which were validated by complementary methods including single-cell genome sequencing. These data sets provide a substantially expanded catalog of genes and genomes participating in the deconstruction of cellulosic biomass.},

@article{Turnbaugh2009Core,
    abstract = {The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing {16S} {rRNA} genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial {16S} {rRNA} sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).},

                Metagenomics is a rapidly emerging field of research for studying microbial communities. To evaluate methods presently used to process metagenomic sequences, we constructed three simulated data sets of varying complexity by combining sequencing reads randomly selected from 113 isolate genomes. These data sets were designed to model real metagenomes in terms of complexity and phylogenetic composition. We assembled sampled reads using three commonly used genome assemblers (Phrap, Arachne and {JAZZ}), and predicted genes using two popular gene-finding pipelines (fgenesb and {CRITICA}/{GLIMMER}). The phylogenetic origins of the assembled contigs were predicted using one sequence similarity-based (blast hit distribution) and two sequence composition-based ({PhyloPythia}, oligonucleotide frequencies) binning methods. We explored the effects of the simulated community structure and method combinations on the fidelity of each processing step by comparison to the corresponding isolate genomes. The simulated data sets are available online to facilitate standardized benchmarking of tools for metagenomic analysis.

@article{Shanks2011Community,
    abstract = {The fecal microbiome of cattle plays a critical role not only in animal health and productivity but also in food safety, pathogen shedding, and the performance of fecal pollution detection methods. Unfortunately, most published molecular surveys fail to provide adequate detail about variability in the community structures of fecal bacteria within and across cattle populations. Using massively parallel pyrosequencing of a hypervariable region of the {rRNA} coding region, we profiled the fecal microbial communities of cattle from six different feeding operations where cattle were subjected to consistent management practices for a minimum of 90 days. We obtained a total of 633,877 high-quality sequences from the fecal samples of 30 adult beef cattle (5 individuals per operation). Sequence-based clustering and taxonomic analyses indicate less variability within a population than between populations. Overall, bacterial community composition correlated significantly with fecal starch concentrations, largely reflected in changes in the Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes populations. In addition, network analysis demonstrated that annotated sequences clustered by management practice and fecal starch concentration, suggesting that the structures of bovine fecal bacterial communities can be dramatically different in different animal feeding operations, even at the phylum and family taxonomic levels, and that the feeding operation is a more important determinant of the cattle microbiome than is the geographic location of the feedlot.},

@article{Besemer1999Heuristic,
    abstract = {
                Computer methods of accurate gene finding in {DNA} sequences require models of protein coding and non-coding regions derived either from experimentally validated training sets or from large amounts of anonymous {DNA} sequence. Here we propose a new, heuristic method producing fairly accurate inhomogeneous Markov models of protein coding regions. The new method needs such a small amount of {DNA} sequence data that the model can be built 'on the fly' by a web server for any {DNA} sequence >400 nt. Tests on 10 complete bacterial genomes performed with the {GeneMark}.hmm program demonstrated the ability of the new models to detect 93.1\% of annotated genes on average, while models built by traditional training predict an average of 93.9\% of genes. Models built by the heuristic approach could be used to find genes in small fragments of anonymous prokaryotic genomes and in genomes of organelles, viruses, phages and plasmids, as well as in highly inhomogeneous genomes where adjustment of models to local {DNA} composition is needed. The heuristic method also gives an insight into the mechanism of codon usage pattern evolution.

@article{Zhu2010Ab,
    abstract = {We describe an algorithm for gene identification in {DNA} sequences derived from shotgun sequencing of microbial communities. Accurate ab initio gene prediction in a short nucleotide sequence of anonymous origin is hampered by uncertainty in model parameters. While several machine learning approaches could be proposed to bypass this difficulty, one effective method is to estimate parameters from dependencies, formed in evolution, between frequencies of oligonucleotides in protein-coding regions and genome nucleotide composition. Original version of the method was proposed in 1999 and has been used since for (i) reconstructing codon frequency vector needed for gene finding in viral genomes and (ii) initializing parameters of self-training gene finding algorithms. With advent of new prokaryotic genomes en masse it became possible to enhance the original approach by using direct polynomial and logistic approximations of oligonucleotide frequencies, as well as by separating models for bacteria and archaea. These advances have increased the accuracy of model reconstruction and, subsequently, gene prediction. We describe the refined method and assess its accuracy on known prokaryotic genomes split into short sequences. Also, we show that as a result of application of the new method, several thousands of new genes could be added to existing annotations of several human and mouse gut metagenomes.},

In a series of tests on Haemophilus influenzae , Helicobacter pylori and other complete microbial genomes, this system has proven to be very accurate at locating virtually all the genes in these sequences, outperforming previous methods. A conservative estimate based on experiments on H.pylori and H. influenzae is that the system finds >97\% of all genes. {GLIMMER} uses interpolated Markov models ({IMMs}) as a framework for capturing dependencies between nearby nucleotides in a {DNA} sequence. An {IMM}-based method makes predictions based on a variable context; i.e., a variable-length oligomer in a {DNA} sequence. The context used by {GLIMMER} changes depending on the local composition of the sequence. As a result, {GLIMMER} is more flexible and more powerful than fixed-order Markov methods, which have previously been the primary content-based technique for finding genes in microbial {DNA}.},

We describe several major changes to the Glimmer system, including improved methods for identifying both coding regions and start codons. We also describe a new module of Glimmer that can distinguish host and endosymbiont {DNA}. This module was developed in response to the discovery that eukaryotic genome sequencing projects sometimes inadvertently capture the {DNA} of intracellular bacteria living in the host. The new methods dramatically reduce the rate of false-positive predictions, while maintaining Glimmer's 99\% sensitivity rate at detecting genes in most species, and they find substantially more correct start sites, as measured by comparisons to known and well-curated genes. We show that our interpolated Markov model ({IMM}) {DNA} discriminator correctly separated 99\% of the sequences in a recent genome project that produced a mixture of sequences from the bacterium Prochloron didemni and its sea squirt host, Lissoclinum patella.

    abstract = {
                Exhaustive gene identification is a fundamental goal in all metagenomics projects. However, most metagenomic sequences are unassembled anonymous fragments, and conventional gene-finding methods cannot be applied. We have developed a prokaryotic gene-finding program, {MetaGene}, which utilizes di-codon frequencies estimated by the {GC} content of a given sequence with other various measures. {MetaGene} can predict a whole range of prokaryotic genes based on the anonymous genomic sequences of a few hundred bases, with a sensitivity of 95\% and a specificity of 90\% for artificial shotgun sequences (700 bp fragments from 12 species). {MetaGene} has two sets of codon frequency interpolations, one for bacteria and one for archaea, and automatically selects the proper set for a given sequence using the domain classification method we propose. The domain classification works properly, correctly assigning domain information to more than 90\% of the artificial shotgun sequences. Applied to the Sargasso Sea dataset, {MetaGene} predicted almost all of the annotated genes and a notable number of novel genes. {MetaGene} can be applied to wide variety of metagenomic projects and expands the utility of metagenomics.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Gene prediction is an essential step in the annotation of metagenomic sequencing reads. Since most metagenomic reads cannot be assembled into long contigs, specialized statistical gene prediction tools have been developed for short and anonymous {DNA} fragments, e.g. {MetaGeneAnnotator} and Orphelia. While conventional gene prediction methods have been subject to a benchmark study on real sequencing reads with typical errors, such a comparison has not been conducted for specialized tools, yet. Their gene prediction accuracy was mostly measured on error free {DNA} {fragments.RESULTS}:In this study, Sanger and pyrosequencing reads were simulated on the basis of models that take all types of sequencing errors into account. All metagenomic gene prediction tools showed decreasing accuracy with increasing sequencing error rates. Performance results on an established metagenomic benchmark dataset are also reported. In addition, we demonstrate that {ESTScan}, a tool for sequencing error compensation in eukaryotic expressed sequence tags, outperforms some metagenomic gene prediction tools on reads with high error rates although it was not designed for the task at {hand.CONCLUSION}:This study fills an important gap in metagenomic gene prediction research. Specialized methods are evaluated and compared with respect to sequencing error robustness. Results indicate that the integration of error-compensating methods into metagenomic gene prediction tools would be beneficial to improve metagenome annotation quality.},

@article{Hoff2009Orphelia,
    abstract = {
                Metagenomic sequencing projects yield numerous sequencing reads of a diverse range of uncultivated and mostly yet unknown microorganisms. In many cases, these sequencing reads cannot be assembled into longer contigs. Thus, gene prediction tools that were originally developed for whole-genome analysis are not suitable for processing metagenomes. Orphelia is a program for predicting genes in short {DNA} sequences that is available through a web server application (http://orphelia.gobics.de). Orphelia utilizes prediction models that were created with machine learning techniques on the basis of a wide range of annotated genomes. In contrast to other methods for metagenomic gene prediction, Orphelia has fragment length-specific prediction models for the two most popular sequencing techniques in metagenomics, chain termination sequencing and pyrosequencing. These models ensure highly specific gene predictions.

@article{Rho2010FragGeneScan,
    abstract = {The advances of next-generation sequencing technology have facilitated metagenomics research that attempts to determine directly the whole collection of genetic material within an environmental sample (i.e. the metagenome). Identification of genes directly from short reads has become an important yet challenging problem in annotating metagenomes, since the assembly of metagenomes is often not available. Gene predictors developed for whole genomes (e.g. Glimmer) and recently developed for metagenomic sequences (e.g. {MetaGene}) show a significant decrease in performance as the sequencing error rates increase, or as reads get shorter. We have developed a novel gene prediction method {FragGeneScan}, which combines sequencing error models and codon usages in a hidden Markov model to improve the prediction of protein-coding region in short reads. The performance of {FragGeneScan} was comparable to Glimmer and {MetaGene} for complete genomes. But for short reads, {FragGeneScan} consistently outperformed {MetaGene} (accuracy improved ∼62\% for reads of 400 bases with 1\% sequencing errors, and ∼18\% for short reads of 100 bases that are error free). When applied to metagenomes, {FragGeneScan} recovered substantially more genes than {MetaGene} predicted (>90\% of the genes identified by homology search), and many novel genes with no homologs in current protein sequence database.},

@article{Noguchi2008MetaGeneAnnotator,
    abstract = {Recent advances in {DNA} sequencers are accelerating genome sequencing, especially in microbes, and complete and draft genomes from various species have been sequenced in rapid succession. Here, we present a comprehensive gene prediction tool, the {MetaGeneAnnotator} ({MGA}), which precisely predicts all kinds of prokaryotic genes from a single or a set of anonymous genomic sequences having a variety of lengths. The {MGA} integrates statistical models of prophage genes, in addition to those of bacterial and archaeal genes, and also uses a self-training model from input sequences for predictions. As a result, the {MGA} sensitively detects not only typical genes but also atypical genes, such as horizontally transferred and prophage genes in a prokaryotic genome. In this paper, we also propose a novel approach for analyzing the ribosomal binding site ({RBS}), which enables us to detect species-specific patterns of the {RBSs}. The {MGA} has the ingenious {RBS} model based on this approach, and precisely predicts translation starts of genes. The {MGA} also succeeds in improving prediction accuracies for short sequences by using the adapted {RBS} models (96\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity for 700 bp fragments). These features of the {MGA} expedite wide ranges of microbial genome studies, such as genome annotations and metagenome analyses.},

Our software can be used to generate collections of synthetic reads that reflect the diverse taxonomical composition of typical metagenome data sets. Based on a database of given genomes, the program allows the user to design a metagenome by specifying the number of genomes present at different levels of the {NCBI} taxonomy, and then to collect reads from the metagenome using a simulation of a number of different sequencing technologies. A population sampler optionally produces evolved sequences based on source genomes and a given evolutionary tree. {MetaSim} allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software.},

@article{Yok2011,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Traditional gene annotation methods rely on characteristics that may not be available in short reads generated from next generation technology, resulting in suboptimal performance for metagenomic (environmental) samples. Therefore, in recent years, new programs have been developed that optimize performance on short reads. In this work, we benchmark three metagenomic gene prediction programs and combine their predictions to improve metagenomic read gene {annotation.RESULTS}:We not only analyze the programs' performance at different read-lengths like similar studies, but also separate different types of reads, including intra- and intergenic regions, for analysis. The main deficiencies are in the algorithms' ability to predict non-coding regions and gene edges, resulting in more false-positives and false-negatives than desired. In fact, the specificities of the algorithms are notably worse than the sensitivities. By combining the programs' predictions, we show significant improvement in specificity at minimal cost to sensitivity, resulting in 4\% improvement in accuracy for 100 bp reads with \~{}1\% improvement in accuracy for 200 bp reads and above. To correctly annotate the start and stop of the genes, we find that a consensus of all the predictors performs best for shorter read lengths while a unanimous agreement is better for longer read lengths, boosting annotation accuracy by 1-8\%. We also demonstrate use of the classifier combinations on a real {dataset.CONCLUSIONS}:To optimize the performance for both prediction and annotation accuracies, we conclude that the consensus of all methods (or a majority vote) is the best for reads 400 bp and shorter, while using the intersection of {GeneMark} and Orphelia predictions is the best for reads 500 bp and longer. We demonstrate that most methods predict over 80\% coding (including partially coding) reads on a real human gut sample sequenced by Illumina technology.},
