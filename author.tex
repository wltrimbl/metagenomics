% For figures use
%

\begin{figure}[t]
\sidecaption[t]
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the option graphics use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
%\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}
\label{fig:2}       % Give a unique label

% Use the \index{} command to code your index words
